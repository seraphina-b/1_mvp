# News US App

The result of this development project is an application for reading current news from US. The reader can choose between different news categories and search/filter them by title.

## Technical design

- Frontend with **React**
- Third party **API** integration. Source: [News API](https://newsapi.org/)

## Future features

- Add ‘Read Later’ / ‘Favourites’
- Include more countries (right now the app just gets news from US).
- 'About' section: information about the company and contact form.

## Setup

1. Run `npm install` to install packages.
2. Run `npm start` to run the server.

If you want to clone the repository in your computer: [Cloning a repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)

## Styling

- Tools used: **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) & [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com)**

## Presentation - What I have learnt

- Creative process
- React (mostly data flow between components)
- Review: Bootstrap
- **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)** E.g. share news in social media using ['react-share'](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-share) and change date format with [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/).

This is a student project that was created at [CodeOp](http://codeop.tech), a full stack development bootcamp in Barcelona.
